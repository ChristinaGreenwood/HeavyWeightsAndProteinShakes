She ended that competition as the runner-up in the Bikini Divas Masters division. Afterward, she dialed in on specific goals and went to work. Fast forward one year later, she proudly held the American flag on the podium with a gold necklace textdraped around her neck (in Bikini Divas Masters) at 2021 Natural Olympia.",
