                    Rebekah Rasmussen's first time competing professionally as a natural bodybuilder was at the <a href="http://rebekah2021.com/">2020 Natural Olympia.</a> 
                    She ended that competition as the runner-up in the Bikini Divas Masters division. Afterward, she dialed in on specific 
                    goals and went to work. Fast forward one year later, she proudly held the American flag on the podium with a gold necklace 
                    draped around her neck (in Bikini Divas Masters) at 2021 Natural Olympia.
