          After over 25 years of running, then cycling, my knees were shot.
          Endurance sports of that nature would come to an end for me. I was
          about to turn 40, feeling out of shape and needed a new challenge. I
          hired a trainer and got my first gym membership in 2019. Strength
          training, lifting weights, super set, drop set, mind muscle
          connection, macros, supplements, all things I knew nothing about or
          had even hear of before. It quickly became a lifestyle change for me
          and my 3 daughters. We loved how we felt. I was challenged by my
          trainer to compete and enter my first Bodybuilding competition in
          August 2020â€¦I was hooked.
